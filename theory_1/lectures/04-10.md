## Goals of this Module
- Have a good understanding of many essential algorithms
- Be able to choose the right algorithm for the right task
- Estimate the running time for an algorithm on different inputs
- Be able to code your algorithms, and explain them to others

## Outline
- Introduction to Algorithms
- Introduction to data structures
- Greedy
- Divide and Conquer
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Search Algorithms

## What is an Algorithm
- A well-defined sequence of steps, taking an input and producing an output
- A problem is a relation between inputs and outputs
- Different algorithms can solve the same problem 
- Different algorithms have different properties

## Why study algorithms
- Algorithms are tools in a toolbox
- The more the better

## Pseudocode
- Not English
    - need more clarity
    - need less ambiguity
- Not code
    - more readable
    - independent of programming languages
    - high level of abstraction
- See page 15 for examples

## Discussion: Multiplication

### Naive Implementation
```
multiply (n, m):
    prod := 0
    while n > 0:
        prod := prod + m
        n := n - 1
    return prod
```

### Doubling Method
```
multiply (n, m):
    if m is even:
        return multiply(2*n, m/2)
    if m is odd:
        return n + multiply(n, (m-1))
```

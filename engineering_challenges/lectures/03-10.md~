# Engineering Challenges

## Intro
- Apparently easier than last year
- The first one is a disciplinary challenge e.g. (Comp sci)
- The second one is an interdisciplinary challenge e.g. (Work with the other people)

## First Project
- Research Based
- Design Based ^^^^^Did she just watch the apprentice on repeat?
- Ask questions, Get answers, Build Solutions
- Projects can be adaptive
	- i.e. Phone -> Smart Phone
- Projects can be innovative
	- i.e. New Things
- Good Design
	- It works
	- Stylish
	- No waste
	- Economic
- Good Engineering
	- Reliable
	- Implementation
	- Invisible (It just works as background)
- Where to get ideas
	- Refine someone else's idea (Steal One)
		- Ask why (why is this a thing?)
		- Ask who (who is this for?)
		- design :: (who, why) --→ (what, where, how)
		- engineering :: design --→ implimentation
